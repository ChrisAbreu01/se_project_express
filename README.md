# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

Is a sophisticated web application developed using the Express.js framework. Its primary objective is to deliver a robust and efficient RESTful API for seamless resource management within the application. The platform streamlines a range of essential tasks and features associated with software engineering projects.

Functionality:

User Authentication: The application provides comprehensive user authentication capabilities, enabling individuals to register, log in, and effectively manage their accounts. Each user is granted access to a personalized dashboard, empowering them to effortlessly view and update their project details.

Resource Creation and Deletion: The application empowers users with the ability to create and delete various resources. This feature facilitates efficient management and organization of project elements, ensuring a structured approach to project development.

## Technologies

Express.js Framework: The web application is built upon the Express.js framework, a widely adopted and efficient framework for developing web applications. Express.js provides an extensive set of tools and features that enhance the development process and ensure optimal performance.

RESTful API: The application follows the principles of a Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. This approach allows for the seamless communication between the client and server, establishing well-defined and efficient APIs to manage resources within the application.

Node.js: The project leverages the power of Node.js, a runtime environment that enables the execution of server-side JavaScript. Node.js ensures optimal performance and scalability, making it an ideal choice for the development of high-performance web applications.

MongoDB: The application utilizes MongoDB, a versatile NoSQL database, to store and manage project data, user information, and other essential resources. MongoDB's flexible and scalable nature provides an ideal solution for handling complex project data efficiently.

Mongoose: The project incorporates Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library designed specifically for MongoDB. Mongoose simplifies interactions with the database by providing a clear and intuitive interface for defining schemas, performing database operations, and managing data.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are employed to create an engaging and interactive user interface. These technologies enable the seamless integration of design and functionality.

Bootstrap: Bootstrap, a widely adopted CSS framework, is utilized to enhance the application's user interface. By leveraging Bootstrap, the application achieves responsiveness across different devices and provides a visually appealing experience for users.

Version Control: The project utilizes Git, a popular version control system, to effectively manage and track changes in the codebase. This allows for efficient collaboration among developers and ensures code integrity throughout the development process.

Agile Methodology: The project may have adopted Agile software development principles, such as iterative development, regular feedback, and continuous integration. By embracing Agile practices, the project team can maintain flexibility and responsiveness while effectively managing software engineering projects.
